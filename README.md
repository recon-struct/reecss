Multiple sources of truth in code are enough to make any software engineer feel
like they need a grounding exercise. This library obliterates that pain point
and seamlessly integrates with other frameworks and libraries.

No more juggling variables like a caffeinated circus clown. With **reecss**,
your CSS and JavaScript can live in harmony, like peanut butter and jelly or
cats and cardboard boxes.

Dive in, stay sane, and let **reecss** handle the rest.
